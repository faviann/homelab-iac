# Per-Host Docker Compose Stacks

This directory defines repo-managed Docker Compose stacks, grouped by `inventory_hostname`. The role deploys `stacks/<host>/` to `/conf/docker/stacks/` inside the target container and starts every discovered `compose.yml` / `compose.yaml`.

## Portability Model

Stack portability is explicit. A stack being under `stacks/<host>/<stack>/` does not mean every input belongs inside the stack folder.

| Tier | Meaning | Examples | Change Style |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Portable app stack | Normal application stack that can carry its Compose files, non-secret `.env.j2`, repo-only `README.md`, and non-secret `stack.yaml` beside the stack. | `stacks/servarr/notifiarr`, `stacks/servarr/kapowarr` | Small stack-local changes are allowed after stack sync deploy exclusions are in place. |
| Host-bound app stack | App stack whose runtime depends on host-local storage, GPU, VPN, external networks, or ownership mechanics. It can still have stack-local docs/metadata, but host mechanics stay in inventory. | `stacks/jellyfin/jellyfin`, `stacks/seedbox/bittorrent` | Keep host dependencies documented in stack metadata; keep deployment mechanics in host vars. |
| Foundational controlled migration | Cross-host or platform stack that other stacks depend on, or that has scripts with hardcoded repo paths. | `stacks/auth/auth`, `stacks/portal/traefik3`, `stacks/portal/dockhand`, `stacks/public/romm` OIDC coupling | Treat as a controlled migration with a dedicated plan. Do not use these as the first metadata/portability pilot. |

Foundational stacks are intentionally less portable. Authentik/OIDC has cross-host coupling, `scripts/authentik_blueprint_sync.py` depends on the current auth stack paths, and `portal_instance` controls portal discovery, Traefik KOP behavior, Hawser inclusion, and Dockhand seeding.

Accepted normalization exceptions are indexed in [ADR-006](../docs/decisions/adr-006-stack-normalization-exceptions.md). Stack-local details live in each stack README.

This directory is only for repo-managed stacks that Ansible deploys and reconciles.

## Stack Contract

```text
stacks/
  <inventory_hostname>/
    <stack_name>/
      compose.yaml
      compose.override.yaml   # optional: vendor-preserving overrides
      .env | .env.j2
      appdata/
```

### Ownership Rules

Stack-owned files:

- `compose.yaml`, `compose.yml`, and optional `compose.override.yaml`
- `.env.j2` when values are rendered from inventory/vault variables
- committed app config under `appdata/`
- stack-local `README.md` and files under `docs/`
- non-secret `stack.yaml` metadata
- Compose extension blocks such as `x-prereq-dirs` and `x-managed-files`

Host/inventory-owned settings:

- `default_domain`
- `lxc_docker_env_stack_vars`
- `proxmox_lxc_overrides`
- `lxc_hwaddr`
- tier and capability group membership
- LXC CPU, RAM, disk, mount, and resource settings
- `lxc_docker_env_external_networks`
- `lxc_docker_env_host_directories`
- `lxc_docker_env_path_ownership_overrides`
- vault-backed secret bindings in `inventory/host_vars/*.yml`
- `portal_instance`, `traefik_kop_enabled`, Hawser, and Dockhand host orchestration

Do not dynamically include stack-local variable files into Ansible host scope. Stack metadata is non-secret role data; templates still render from normal Ansible inventory, group, host, and vault variables plus the injected `stack_name`.

- Host folder must match `inventory_hostname`.
- Stack folder name becomes the Compose project name. During `.j2` rendering, the role also injects `stack_name`.
- `.j2` files are rendered with inventory, host, group, vault variables, `stack_name`, and the current stack `stack_vars` task-scoped render data, then deployed without the `.j2` suffix.
- Other files are copied verbatim.
- Stack-local `README.md`, `docs/**`, `stack.yaml`, `stack.yml`, and `metadata.*` files are repo-only and are excluded from deployment.
- Do not use stack-local metadata for secrets or runtime variable injection.
- Compose-relative persistent data should live under `./appdata/...`.
- All bind-mount target directories must exist before first deploy. If they do not, Docker creates them as root on first start, causing permission errors for non-root container processes. Declare dirs that need pre-creation in an `x-prereq-dirs` block in the repo-managed compose definition for the stack; the Ansible role creates each missing directory on the LXC with Docker user ownership and mode `0755`. This is create-if-absent behavior: once a declared directory exists, `x-prereq-dirs` does not change its mode, owner, or group. Use `compose.yaml` by default. If the stack intentionally preserves an upstream vendor `compose.yaml`, place `x-prereq-dirs` in `compose.override.yaml` instead. This applies to empty `./appdata/` dirs, `/ephemeral/<stack>/` paths, and new `/data/` subpaths.
- Files that must exist before container start with a specific mode can be declared in `x-managed-files`. Relative `./` paths are resolved from the deployed stack directory. Repository-synced files are rendered or copied directly with the declaration's mode; other declared files are created empty when absent without truncating existing content. This is intended for generated state files such as Traefik ACME storage that must exist with restricted permissions.
- Dirs that contain committed files do not need an `x-prereq-dirs` entry; Ansible creates them automatically when deploying the files.
- Do not use `.gitkeep`.
- If both `.env` and `.env.j2` exist for the same output path, the templated output wins.
- Hosts with no folder here are valid; they just get no repo-managed stacks.

| Path Type | Purpose | Example | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `./appdata/...` | Persistent container config or state | `./appdata/jellyfin/config` | Use `x-prereq-dirs` only when the dir is otherwise empty |
| `/ephemeral/...` | Regenerable data on fast local storage | `/ephemeral/romm/resources` | Declare in `x-prereq-dirs` if the stack needs it created |
| `/data/...` | Shared external pool | `/data/media` | Only declare new subpaths in `x-prereq-dirs`; leave pre-existing paths alone |

## Stack Metadata

Portable and host-bound app stacks may include `stack.yaml` for non-secret metadata:

```yaml
schema_version: 1
kind: stack
name: notifiarr
description: Notification and automation companion
portability:
  tier: portable-app
  owner: stack
runtime:
  template_inputs:
    - docker_uid
    - docker_gid
    - default_domain
    - stack_name
  host_requirements:
    external_networks:
      - shared
    host_directories: []
    ownership_overrides: []
exposure:
  traefik: protected
  homepage_instances:
    - admin
updates:
  mode: images
  track: stable
  services:
    database:
      track: "16"
```

Rules:

- `stack.yaml` is not copied to `/conf/docker/stacks`.
- During deployment, stack sync parses `stack.yaml` only as
  `lxc_stack_sync_manifest_plan.stack_metadata`; repository policy validation
  independently reads it to validate and normalize the stack update policy.
- `stack.yaml` must not contain secrets, vault references, API tokens, passwords, private keys, or credentials.
- Neither use loads `stack.yaml` into Ansible variable scope: it does not define
  Ansible variables or override host vars.
- Host requirements listed in metadata are documentation until a future explicit aggregation design exists.

### Image Update Policy

An image-tracked stack declares `updates.mode: images`. Its optional stack-level `track` is the default image update track. `updates.services.<compose-service>.track` supplies an exception or complete per-service coverage when there is no shared default. Service keys always name services from effective Compose after the supported `compose.override.yaml` or `compose.override.yml` has been applied. Every effective image-bearing service must have an intentional effective image update track; a service without an image cannot be selected.

An update procedure is stack-wide and assisted only:

```yaml
updates:
  mode: images
  track: stable
  procedure:
    mode: assisted
    runbook: docs/upgrade.md
```

The runbook path is relative to the stack directory and must resolve to a repository file. Per-service assistance and permanent service exclusions are unsupported. A missing `stack.yaml`, missing `updates`, unknown service, missing image update track, or secret-shaped metadata is a strict validation failure.

### Vendor Update Policy

A vendor-tracked stack preserves an official upstream Compose file byte for byte
as `compose.yaml`, with its local behavior isolated in the optional
`compose.override.yaml` layer:

```yaml
updates:
  mode: vendor
  track: stable
  upstream:
    repository: https://github.com/goauthentik/authentik
    compose_path: docker-compose.yml
  services:
    independently-released-helper:
      track: stable
```

`updates.upstream.repository` must be one canonical
`https://github.com/<owner>/<repository>` URL,
`updates.upstream.compose_path` must stay relative to that repository, and
`updates.track` selects the maintained vendor line. The validator resolves that track to a commit and
requires the configured path at that commit to exactly match `compose.yaml`.
Unlisted services move with the vendor baseline; only independently tracked
images belong in `updates.services`. Vendor bases named `compose.yml`, local
overrides named `compose.override.yml`, direct edits to the vendor base, and
layouts requiring assisted restructuring fail strict validation. Such a stack
should use image mode until its upstream base and local override can follow the
vendor contract.

Validate exactly one repo-managed stack without changing repository or deployed state:

```bash
./validate.sh stack stacks/<host>/<stack>
```

The command writes schema-versioned JSON to standard output, diagnostics to standard error, and exits nonzero for an invalid contract. Its normalized result is the shared validation model for later planning and Create Stack integration. It exposes the effective image-bearing services and image tracks, vendor authority and resolved baseline when applicable, vendor track, assisted procedure, explicit low-confidence policy, and foundational controlled-migration status. Consumers should not reparse raw metadata or infer service risk from image names.

### Repository Input Snapshot API

`build_repository_snapshot` is the canonical read-only Python API for creating a repository input snapshot for caller-selected repo-managed stacks:

```python
from pathlib import Path

from stack_update_policy import build_repository_snapshot

build = build_repository_snapshot(
    Path.cwd(),
    ["stacks/servarr/notifiarr"],
)
```

The API infers the GitHub `owner/repository` identity only from `origin`, reads GitHub for the current default branch and its commit, and rejects the snapshot unless local `HEAD` is exactly that commit. It does not require a clean worktree. For each selected stack it fingerprints the checked-in `stack.yaml`, checked-in supported Compose base and override names, and any repository-local assisted runbook named by the checked-in policy. Locally added or deleted supported Compose names are also relevant. A changed relevant input marks only that stack incomplete; unrelated changes do not affect completeness or fingerprints.

The result is immutable and exposes `as_dict()` for stable schema-versioned consumption. It does not select stacks, validate policy, inspect containers or deployments, invoke Renovate, write GitHub state, or modify the repository. Tests replace only the GitHub read boundary; Git and filesystem behavior use real temporary repositories.

Run the credential-free snapshot contract tests with the locked environment:

```bash
./validate.sh tests tests/unit/test_stack_update_policy_snapshot.py
```

### Image Update Planning Selection

`build_stack_selection` creates the read-only, versioned scope used before image
discovery. Its default scope is the union of checked-in repo-managed stacks and
stack identities retained by open image update proposals. A removed or renamed
stack therefore remains selectable while its open proposal needs resolution.
Closed proposals are loaded only for selected current stacks; a closed proposal
alone does not add its identity to the default scope.

Host and stack filters are exact and repeatable. Repeated values within one
dimension are ORed, while host and stack dimensions are ANDed. Globs and regular
expressions are unsupported, and a filter that matches neither a current stack
nor an open marked proposal fails before image discovery. A proposal-only match
is valid.

Proposal identity comes only from the supported versioned hidden marker, which
records the canonical `stacks/<host>/<stack>` identity and proposal fingerprint.
Titles and labels are presentation, not identity. Duplicate open proposals make
that stack incomplete. A malformed, duplicated, or unsupported marker makes
repository-wide proposal discovery untrustworthy and stops selection without
repairing or guessing identity. Selection performs GitHub reads only and never
inspects deployed containers.

A checked-in stack without `stack.yaml` or without an `updates` section is
reported as `policy-not-configured`. Broad planning can report and skip that
legacy stack without changing an existing proposal; strict single-stack
validation continues to reject the missing policy.

Run the credential-free contract tests with the locked environment:

```bash
./validate.sh tests tests/unit/test_stack_update_policy_selection.py
```

## Build a Stack

1. Create `stacks/<host>/<stack>/compose.yaml`.
2. Add `.env` or `.env.j2` if the stack needs environment variables.
3. For bind-mount target dirs that need pre-creation, add an `x-prereq-dirs` block to the repo-managed compose definition for the stack. Use `compose.yaml` by default. If you are intentionally preserving a vendor upstream base compose, put it in `compose.override.yaml` instead. Dirs that already contain committed config files need no entry.
4. Add Traefik and Homepage labels only to the user-facing service.
5. Deploy with:

```bash
./run.sh --limit <host>
```

To iterate on a single stack without reconciling the others:

```bash
./run.sh --limit <host> --stack <stack>
```

No registration step is required; the role discovers everything under `stacks/<host>/` automatically.

## Holding a Stack Out of Reconciliation

A hold is persisted stop intent for one stack. It lives on the host as an empty marker file at `/shared/<host>/held-stacks/<stack>`, beside the stack directories, so it survives later syncs and host restarts.

```bash
./run.sh hold --limit <host> --stack <stack>     # set
./run.sh held --limit <host>                     # list
./run.sh release --limit <host> --stack <stack>  # clear
```

A sync skips a held stack. It renders, copies, starts, and quarantines nothing for it, and reports it under `skipped_stacks`. Every other stack on the host reconciles as usual. `./run.sh --limit <host> --stack <held stack>` fails until you release the hold.

A hold is intent only. It stops nothing. Stop the containers and check their actual state yourself.

`hold` takes the exclusive lifecycle lock. Exit 0 means no sync was running on this control node, and every later sync sees the hold. Exit 75 means another live operation on this control node holds the lock, and the message names it. Retry after it finishes. Runs from other control nodes are not coordinated.

Limits:

- `docker-agents` cannot be held. `lxc_docker_environment` manages it outside stack sync.
- Ownership overrides and the `*.md` cleanup still run on every sync. They touch data ownership and repo-only docs, not Compose inputs or services.

## Traefik

Some Docker hosts act as label sources for Traefik on `portal`: `traefik-kop` copies their Docker labels into portal's Redis. Stacks on the reverse-proxy host use Traefik directly.

### Discovery Contract

- `traefik.enable=true` means the service should be routed.
- No Traefik labels means the service stays internal.
- Put labels on the user-facing container, not sidecars or databases.
- `traefik.domain=<domain>` only overrides the host's `default_domain`.
- Use an explicit `traefik.http.routers.<name>.rule=Host(...)` only when you need a non-default hostname.

Default hostname:

```text
Host(`<compose-project>.<default_domain>`)
```

### Defaults You Should Not Restate

- `websecure` is the default entrypoint.
- TLS is automatic on `websecure`.

So you normally should not add `entrypoints=websecure` or `tls=true`.

### Common Patterns

| Situation | Labels |
| --- | --- |
| Standard routed service | `traefik.enable=true` |
| Protected routed service | above + `traefik.http.routers.<router>.middlewares=protected-edge-auth@file` |
| Different domain than host default | above + `traefik.domain=<domain>` |
| Custom hostname | above + `traefik.http.routers.<name>.rule=Host(...)` |
| Ambiguous service port | above + `traefik.http.services.<name>.loadbalancer.server.port=<port>` |

Public services should omit the auth middleware label. Protected tiers add it explicitly.

Port labels name the port Traefik can reach. For label-exported routes, such as routes copied by `traefik-kop` from a Docker host that is not running the reverse proxy, Traefik reaches the service through the published host port. If the service publishes `host_port:container_port` and those ports differ, set `traefik.http.services.<name>.loadbalancer.server.port` to the host port.

Example:

```yaml
services:
  myapp:
    ports:
      - 8990:8989
    labels:
      traefik.enable: true
      traefik.http.services.myapp.loadbalancer.server.port: 8990
```

### Usually Leave Unlabeled

- internal databases and caches
- workers/background jobs
- internal helper APIs
- VPN support containers

### Shared Docker Network

Use one external `shared` network when multiple stacks on the same LXC need stable Docker-network access to each other. This is host-local cross-stack plumbing; it is not a cross-LXC network.

```yaml
services:
  myapp:
    networks:
      - shared

networks:
  shared:
    external: true
```

Also declare the external network in host vars:

```yaml
lxc_docker_env_external_networks:
  - shared
```

Older stacks used inconsistent legacy names for this pattern. Use `shared` so
host-local shared networks are named consistently across LXCs.

Do not add `shared` only because a stack has Traefik labels or because `traefik-kop` exports those labels. Label-exported routes need a reachable published port; `shared` is only for same-LXC stack-to-stack traffic.

### Domains

Set `default_domain` per host in `inventory/host_vars/<host>.yml`. The docker-agents `.env.j2` passes it to traefik-kop as `DOMAIN`.

| Host | `default_domain` | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `portal` | `faviann.com` | `media.faviann.com` |
| `seedbox` | `admin.faviann.com` | `bittorrent.admin.faviann.com` |
| `jellyfin` | `public.faviann.com` | `jellyfin.public.faviann.com` |

When adding a new tier subdomain, also add its wildcard SAN in `stacks/portal/traefik3/appdata/traefik3/config/traefik.yaml` or TLS will fail.

## Review Checklist

1. Exposure intent is explicit.
2. Only user-facing services carry Traefik labels.
3. Homepage labels match the intended access tier.
4. All bind-mount target dirs that need pre-creation are declared in `x-prereq-dirs` in the repo-managed compose definition for the stack. `compose.yaml` is the default location; vendor-preserving stacks may use `compose.override.yaml`. No `.gitkeep` files.
5. Any new subdomain tier also updates Traefik SANs.
6. Secrets live in vault-backed `.env.j2`, not static `.env`.
7. Stateful databases should not use floating `latest` tags; pin them and give them a realistic `stop_grace_period`.
8. Portability tier is clear: portable app, host-bound app, or foundational controlled migration.
9. Host-level deployment mechanics remain in inventory/host vars, not stack metadata.
10. Stack-local docs and `stack.yaml` contain no plaintext secrets or secret-shaped values.
11. Foundational stacks (`auth`, `portal`, Authentik/OIDC-coupled public apps) are changed only through dedicated migration plans.

## Notes

- The role discovers both `compose.yml` and `compose.yaml`.
- A host with no folder here is not an error.
