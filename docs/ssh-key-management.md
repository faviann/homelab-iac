# SSH Key Management for Existing LXC Containers

## When You Need This

LXC containers created outside of Ansible (manually or by other tools) won't have the control node's SSH public key, preventing Ansible from connecting. This also applies if the provisioning phase's SSH injection step failed.

## Automated Playbook (Recommended)

```bash
# All containers
uv run --locked ansible-playbook playbooks/add-ssh-keys-to-lxcs.yml

# Specific container(s)
uv run --locked ansible-playbook playbooks/add-ssh-keys-to-lxcs.yml --limit portal
uv run --locked ansible-playbook playbooks/add-ssh-keys-to-lxcs.yml --limit portal,seedbox
```

The playbook uses `pct exec` on the Proxmox host — containers don't need to be SSH-accessible beforehand. It is idempotent and non-destructive (only adds, never removes keys).

**Prerequisites**: Container must be running; Proxmox host SSH access must be configured (run `uv run --locked ansible-playbook site.yml --tags bootstrap` first if needed).

## Manual Method (via Proxmox host)

If the playbook isn't working:

```bash
ssh root@proxmox.lan

VMID=300
PUBKEY="$(cat ~/.ansible/ssh/proxmox_lxc.pub)"  # run on control node first

pct exec $VMID -- mkdir -p /root/.ssh
pct exec $VMID -- chmod 700 /root/.ssh
pct exec $VMID -- bash -c "echo '$PUBKEY' >> /root/.ssh/authorized_keys"
pct exec $VMID -- chmod 600 /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

## Verification

```bash
ansible lxcs -m ping
ansible portal -m ping  # single host
```
