# Workstation Persistent State

## When You Need This

The workstation role bind-mounts selected home paths from `/ephemeral/workstation/home` so they survive an intentional LXC rebuild.

**Status: the original ten declared paths were migrated and mounted as of 2026-08-13, and their rebuild persistence was validated 2026-08-15/16.** Four paths now extend that contract for OpenCode and Oh My Pi (OMP): `~/.omp`, `~/.config/opencode`, `~/.local/share/opencode`, and `~/.local/state/opencode`. Moraine's complete local runtime root extends it at `~/.moraine`. Lobu's durable auth/device root extends it at `~/.config/lobu`; its live rebuild validation is pending (#270). Migrate newly declared paths before the first deploy that includes them, then include them in the next rebuild validation.

Note that `~/.claude.json` is a sibling of the mounted `~/.claude` and is therefore *not* covered — see #157.

`~/.pi` remains the Pi harness state root. OMP is a separate harness with separate state under `~/.omp`; neither path replaces or contains the other. OpenCode's three durable XDG roots preserve its configuration, authentication, and session state. Read this runbook before the first `site.yml` run that enables any newly declared path.

## The Fail-Closed Assert

`playbooks/roles/config/lxc_workstation_baseline/tasks/persistent_home.yml` refuses to mount over a home path that already exists as a plain directory and is neither a symlink to the target nor already a bind mount. The run fails with:

```
/home/faviann/.config/herdr exists and is not the managed bind mount path from
/ephemeral/workstation/home/.config/herdr. Move or migrate it manually before enabling
workstation persistent home mounts.
```

This is deliberate. A bind mount hides whatever is underneath it, so mounting over populated directories would silently orphan the existing data instead of persisting it. The role stops and makes a human decide.

## Pre-Deploy Migration

Run these on the workstation, as the workstation user, before `site.yml --limit workstation`.

### Lobu

Before enabling `~/.config/lobu`, stop the Lobu daemon through the dotfiles-owned
user-service lifecycle provided by [faviann/dotfiles#112](https://github.com/faviann/dotfiles/issues/112).
Use the actual unit name documented there; this repository does not define it.
An intentional service stop must remain stopped. Exit any manually launched
`lobu daemon` and other Lobu CLI processes too, and confirm no Lobu process is
running before copying. Keep them stopped until the mount has been verified.

Run the following as the workstation user in a subshell. It refuses an existing
backing target or backup (including dangling symlinks), so rerunning cannot nest
or overwrite state. If either exists, inspect the previous migration before
proceeding; a failed configuration run may already have created an empty target.

```bash
(
  set -eu
  source_path="$HOME/.config/lobu"
  target_path=/ephemeral/workstation/home/.config/lobu
  backup_path="$HOME/.config/lobu.pre-persist"
  if [ -e "$source_path" ] || [ -L "$source_path" ]; then
    test -d "$source_path"
    test ! -L "$source_path"
    if mountpoint -q "$source_path"; then
      echo 'Lobu is already mounted; inspect the mount before migrating.' >&2
      exit 1
    fi
    test ! -e "$target_path"
    test ! -L "$target_path"
    test ! -e "$backup_path"
    test ! -L "$backup_path"
    mkdir -p /ephemeral/workstation/home/.config
    cp -a "$source_path" "$target_path"
    chmod 0700 "$target_path"
    mv "$source_path" "$backup_path"
    chmod 0700 "$backup_path"
  fi
)
```

If the source is absent, no copy or rename is needed. The role creates the target
and mount point. `cp -a` preserves child-file ownership, modes, ACLs, and xattrs;
the role sets only the top-level directories to `0700`, without recursive chmod.
Treat the backup as sensitive too and retain it until deploy and rebuild validation
succeed. Never print `credentials.json` or device file contents.

Follow [Deploying](#deploying), then verify the exact mount and directory metadata:

```bash
findmnt --mountpoint "$HOME/.config/lobu"
stat -c '%a %U:%G %n' ~/.config/lobu /ephemeral/workstation/home/.config/lobu
```

Require the intended backing path and `700` with the workstation user's ownership
on both directories before restarting the dotfiles-owned service. Lobu installation,
login, and supervision remain owned by dotfiles; this change only persists state.

### Other tools

Before enabling the Moraine mapping, stop Moraine through the dotfiles-owned
user-service lifecycle so its managed ClickHouse data and checkpoints are not
changing during the copy. Preserve the complete runtime root and keep a
recoverable pre-persistence copy until validation succeeds:

```bash
mkdir -p /ephemeral/workstation/home
cp -a ~/.moraine /ephemeral/workstation/home/.moraine
mv ~/.moraine ~/.moraine.pre-persist
```

Omit the copy and move when `~/.moraine` does not exist; the role creates the
backing target and mount point during fresh convergence.

Before enabling the OpenCode and OMP mappings, exit every OpenCode and OMP process so their state is not changing during the copy. Copy each existing durable root to the corresponding persistent target, preserving ownership, modes, ACLs, and xattrs:

```bash
mkdir -p /ephemeral/workstation/home/.config \
         /ephemeral/workstation/home/.local/share \
         /ephemeral/workstation/home/.local/state

cp -a ~/.omp /ephemeral/workstation/home/.omp
cp -a ~/.config/opencode /ephemeral/workstation/home/.config/opencode
cp -a ~/.local/share/opencode /ephemeral/workstation/home/.local/share/opencode
cp -a ~/.local/state/opencode /ephemeral/workstation/home/.local/state/opencode

mv ~/.omp ~/.omp.pre-persist
mv ~/.config/opencode ~/.config/opencode.pre-persist
mv ~/.local/share/opencode ~/.local/share/opencode.pre-persist
mv ~/.local/state/opencode ~/.local/state/opencode.pre-persist
```

The block assumes all four sources exist. Omit both the `cp` and matching `mv` line for any source that is absent; the role creates its persistent target and mount point. Keep the `.pre-persist` copies until the deploy and post-rebuild validation succeed. Do not copy `~/.cache/opencode`: it is reconstructible cache data and deliberately remains ephemeral.

Stop both first. herdr keeps live Unix sockets in `~/.config/herdr` and rewrites `session.json` as panes change; Collie writes into `~/.local/state/collie`. Copying either directory while it is running captures a torn session snapshot, and a graceful stop is what makes herdr write its final one.

Collie runs as its own generated user service, plus an origin-forwarder service and its activating socket unit. Stop the socket first — leaving it active lets the next connection reactivate the service underneath the copy. herdr currently runs as a detached `herdr server` process with no user unit, so stop it through its own API:

```bash
systemctl --user stop collie-origin-forwarder.socket collie-origin-forwarder.service
systemctl --user stop collie
herdr server stop
```

Once the dotfiles herdr supervision slice lands, herdr gains a user service and `systemctl --user stop herdr` replaces the last command. Check with `systemctl --user list-unit-files | grep herdr` before assuming either form.

Confirm nothing came back before copying:

```bash
systemctl --user list-units --state=active | grep -E 'collie|herdr'   # expect no output
pgrep -af 'herdr|collie'                                              # expect no output
```

Stopping herdr ends the processes running in its panes. That is a known and accepted property of the herdr cutover, not a surprise — schedule this migration when no important pane work is in flight. Restart both after the deploy, following [Restarting Afterwards](#restarting-afterwards).

**herdr does not use tmux.** It runs its own panes as direct children of the `herdr server` process, so `tmux list-sessions` tells you nothing about what you are about to kill. List the real panes and what is running in them:

```bash
for p in $(pgrep -P "$(pgrep -f 'herdr server')"); do
  printf '%-8s ' "$(ps -o tty= -p "$p")"
  ps -o args= -p $(pgrep -P "$p") 2>/dev/null || echo '<idle>'
done
```

`/ephemeral` is a separate filesystem, so use a copy mode that preserves ownership, modes, ACLs, and xattrs. `cp -a` implies `--preserve=all` and does; a bare `cp` drops them. Use coreutils rather than rsync — rsync is not a workstation package, so it is not there on a freshly rebuilt LXC.

```bash
mkdir -p /ephemeral/workstation/home/.config /ephemeral/workstation/home/.local/state

cp -a ~/.config/herdr /ephemeral/workstation/home/.config/herdr
cp -a ~/.local/state/collie /ephemeral/workstation/home/.local/state/collie
```

Collie's env file holds the VAPID private key at mode `0600`. Verify it survived before moving anything aside:

```bash
stat -c '%a %U:%G %n' \
  /ephemeral/workstation/home/.config/herdr/plugins/config/herdr.collie/.env
# expect: 600 faviann:faviann ...
```

Then move the originals aside so the assert sees empty (or absent) mount points. Rename rather than delete — a failed migration is then recoverable:

```bash
mv ~/.config/herdr ~/.config/herdr.pre-persist
mv ~/.local/state/collie ~/.local/state/collie.pre-persist
```

Once the post-rebuild validation below passes, delete the `.pre-persist` copies.

The `0700` mode in `workstation_persistent_home_links` applies to the mount point and the target directory only. It is never applied recursively — file modes inside, including the `0600` env file, are left exactly as they are. Note this can *tighten* an existing directory: `~/.config/herdr` was `0775` before the mount and is `0700` after.

## Deploying

The workstation is the Ansible control node, and `proxmox_skip_self` defaults to true — so a run launched here skips the workstation and reports success having changed nothing. Pass `-e proxmox_skip_self=false` to target it deliberately. Drive it from a plain SSH shell, not from inside a herdr pane.

**Check before applying.** This is the load-bearing step, not an optional dry run:

```bash
./run.sh --check \
  -e proxmox_skip_self=false --limit workstation > /tmp/ws-check.log 2>&1
rg "restart_required|failed=|unreachable=" /tmp/ws-check.log
```

Require zero failed and zero unreachable, and no host-config restart. Before a migration this check *fails* at the persistent-home guard — that is expected, and is the "before" evidence.

Why the restart matters more than anything else: `proxmox_lxc_host_config/tasks/main.yml` issues `pct reboot` from the Proxmox host when any host-config component reports `restart_required`, and it fires early, before guest configuration. A container restart kills any Ansible process running inside the container, so the run dies before reaching the workstation role. `restart_required` is computed in check mode, so the check reports it truthfully in advance.

**Detach the apply**, so an SSH disconnect cannot kill it. Lingering is enabled and `KillUserProcesses` is unset, so a transient user unit outlives the session:

```bash
systemd-run --user --unit=ws-deploy --collect \
  bash -lc 'cd ~/repos/homelab-iac/<worktree> && \
    ./run.sh \
    -e proxmox_skip_self=false \
    -e lxc_base_system_reboot_enabled=false \
    --limit workstation > /tmp/ws-deploy.log 2>&1'

journalctl --user -u ws-deploy -f
systemctl --user show ws-deploy -p ExecMainStatus   # 0 when it finished cleanly
```

`-e lxc_base_system_reboot_enabled=false` suppresses the end-of-run guest reboot, which fires when `/var/run/reboot-required` exists — an `apt` upgrade during the run can create it. Reboot deliberately afterwards once the recap is clean.

Detaching survives an SSH drop. It does not survive a container restart — nothing running inside the container does. That is why the check comes first.

**The LXC will not be destroyed by this run.** `proxmox_lxc_rebuild_on_release_mismatch` and `proxmox_lifecycle_allow_destructive_transitions` are both `false` in `inventory/group_vars/all/proxmox.yml` and unset in `host_vars/workstation.yml`, so the planner cannot emit `rebuild` or `remove`, and an unauthorized destructive plan fails the run rather than executing it. The expected transition for a running workstation is `provision`, non-destructive.

Afterwards, confirm the mounts are actually live rather than trusting the play recap — an unmounted bind mount is an empty directory, not an error:

```bash
findmnt ~/.claude ~/.codex ~/.agents ~/.pi ~/.omp ~/.moraine \
        ~/.config/opencode ~/.local/share/opencode ~/.local/state/opencode \
        ~/.config/lobu ~/.config/agent-of-empires ~/.hermes ~/.openclaw ~/.config/herdr \
        ~/.local/state/collie ~/repos
```

Every declared path must appear. A missing row is an unmounted bind mount, and the play recap will not have flagged it.

## Restarting Afterwards

Start herdr, then `systemctl --user start collie`. Collie pulls up its origin socket through `Wants=collie-origin-forwarder.socket`, so that is the whole sequence. Starting Collie first also works — its bridge polls for herdr and retries — but it logs a `cannot reach Herdr socket` line that looks like a failure and is not.

`Wants` is soft, so a socket that fails to bind leaves Collie started and reporting healthy while nothing outside can reach it. Confirm the listener rather than the unit state:

```bash
ss -tln | grep 8788
```

Nothing there is the signature of an unreachable Collie: the phone gets no route and the PWA sits on "waiting for herdr", which reads like a herdr fault when herdr is fine.

## What Is Deliberately Not Persisted

- `~/.config/systemd/user/collie.service` — Collie regenerates this unit, and it embeds checkout-specific paths. A persisted copy would pin stale paths across a rebuild.
- `~/.local/state/herdr/agent-detection` — a herdr cache, rebuilt on demand. Persisting it keeps stale detection results alive.
- `~/.lobu/cache` — Lobu reconstructible cache; only `~/.config/lobu` is persisted.
- `~/.cache/opencode` — OpenCode cache data is reconstructible and remains on the container-owned filesystem.

Note that the specific `~/.local/state/collie` and `~/.local/state/opencode` children are mounted, not `~/.local/state`. Mounting the parent would drag unrelated reconstructible state into the contract. The same narrow-path rule keeps `~/.cache/opencode` outside the persistence contract.

## Rebuilding the LXC

**Status: validated 2026-08-15/16.** The procedure below is what was actually run; see #95 for the recorded observations.

### The planner cannot be asked for a rebuild

`proxmox_lxc_lifecycle/tasks/decide.yml` computes `rebuild_required` as a release mismatch **and** `proxmox_lxc_rebuild_on_release_mismatch`. There is no manual override. When the guest release already matches the ostemplate — the normal case — setting both destructive policy flags to `true` still yields a `provision` transition and destroys nothing.

So destroy the container out-of-band, in the Proxmox web UI. With it absent, the planner emits the ordinary create path:

```
container_transition: provision
destructive: false
reason: "Container is absent from Proxmox, so it will be provisioned."
```

Both policy flags stay `false` and nothing needs authorizing or restoring afterwards.

**`/ephemeral` is not at risk.** `mp2: "/ephemeral,mp=/ephemeral"` is a Proxmox host path, not a container-owned volume, so destroy cannot reclaim it. `mp0` belongs to container 200, so "Destroy unreferenced disks owned by guest" leaves it alone too. The safeguard that matters is confirming you are destroying **vmid 306 / `workstation`**.

### Before destroying

Record a "before" manifest. Once the container is gone, the only evidence of the prior state is what you wrote down, and the acceptance criteria ask that herdr restores the *same* plugins and Collie keeps the *same* identity:

```bash
sha256sum ~/.config/herdr/session.json ~/.config/herdr/plugins.json \
          ~/.config/herdr/plugins/config/herdr.collie/.env \
          ~/.local/state/collie/push-subscriptions.json
```

Hash the VAPID `.env`; never copy or print it. It is the one genuinely irreplaceable artifact — deliberately absent from Bitwarden, and existing only on `/ephemeral`.

Also capture the file list for each OpenCode and OMP durable root and keep that output on the driving machine. After the rebuild, compare it with a fresh listing to prove that the separate OMP state and all three OpenCode roots returned:

```bash
find ~/.omp ~/.config/opencode ~/.local/share/opencode ~/.local/state/opencode \
  -type f -print | sort
```

`~/.cache/opencode` is intentionally absent from this manifest and is not a rebuild failure if empty or missing afterwards.

A graceful herdr/Collie shutdown is **not** required here. The migration procedure above needs one because `cp -a` reads the directory for seconds while herdr writes into it; a destroy interrupts at most one in-flight write. Testing the crash path is also the more honest test, since a real rebuild will not be preceded by a polite shutdown.

Also bank `~/.ansible/ssh/proxmox_lxc` somewhere off the container — see the recovery table below for why.

### Lobu before-manifest

Lobu rebuild validation is **pending**. Once initialized, quiesce Lobu as described
above and record a hash manifest without printing file contents. Keep the daemon
stopped while recording it:

```bash
(
  set -eu
  umask 077
  cd ~/.config/lobu
  find . -type f -exec sha256sum -- {} + > "$HOME/lobu-before.sha256"
)
```

Keep this protected manifest on the driving machine before destroying the LXC.
It covers `credentials.json` and files under `devices/` when present. Record the
registered device identifier using the control plane's device view, without copying
tokens or credentials. The earlier herdr/Collie crash-path guidance does not replace
this quiescence requirement for a stable Lobu comparison.

After recreation, verify the Lobu mount and compare the restored files against the
manifest **before** starting Lobu. Coordinate dotfiles convergence so its service
cannot auto-start and rewrite state ahead of this check. With the manifest restored
to the workstation user's home:

```bash
(cd ~/.config/lobu && sha256sum --check --quiet "$HOME/lobu-before.sha256")
```

Then complete dotfiles convergence, start the supervised daemon, and confirm the
same registered device reconnects without login or re-enrollment. Runtime startup
can legitimately update credentials, so use the pre-start hashes to prove file
preservation and the control-plane identity to prove runtime reuse. Record the live
result before marking Lobu rebuild validation complete.

### Drive it from another machine

Not from the workstation. The container is replaced, so anything running inside it dies with it — including the Ansible run.

The manual destroy skips the cleanup that `provision.yml` performs on the planner's rebuild path, so do it yourself on the driving machine:

```bash
rm -f .ansible/cache/*_workstation
ssh-keygen -R workstation && ssh-keygen -R workstation.faviann.vms
```

Then deploy. Skip `--check`: it is load-bearing when an existing container might report `restart_required`, but with no container to observe it cannot tell you anything.

```bash
./run.sh --limit workstation \
  -e proxmox_skip_self=false -e lxc_base_system_reboot_enabled=false
```

`lxc_hwaddr` is pinned in `host_vars/workstation.yml`, so the container returns on the same MAC and address.

### What does not come back on its own

| Path | Recovery |
|---|---|
| `~/.local/share/chezmoi`, `~/.ssh/id_ed25519`, `~/.ssh/config`, `~/.ssh/allowed_signers`, `~/.ansible/vault-pass` | `workstation-setup`, one Bitwarden unlock |
| `~/.config/gh` | Same unlock — the token is read from Bitwarden and piped to `gh auth login --with-token`. There is no interactive `gh` login. |
| `~/.local/state/workstation-setup/complete` | Rewritten by `workstation-setup`, which is offered automatically on your first interactive SSH login |
| `~/.ansible/ssh/proxmox_lxc` | **Manual copy.** Neither persisted nor chezmoi-managed, and `validate_environment` does not check it, so setup reports ready without it. |
| `collie.service` | Regenerated by the herdr plugin's `start` action — see below |

Do **not** recover `proxmox_lxc` by running `bootstrap.yml` on the rebuilt workstation. `control_node_bootstrap/tasks/ssh_key.yml` uses `openssh_keypair`, which generates when the file is absent, producing a new key that no LXC in the fleet trusts.

`chezmoi apply` will not clobber the copied key: the source directories are `private_dot_ansible` and `private_dot_ssh`. `private_` only forces `0700` — it is not `exact_`, so unmanaged files inside are left alone.

### Starting Collie

Collie's bridge does not auto-start with the herdr server, and `collie.service` is deliberately not persisted (it embeds the plugin install hash and a nix profile path). After a rebuild the forwarder listens on 8788 with no backend, and connections fail with `Connection refused`. Start it through the plugin:

```bash
herdr plugin action invoke start --plugin herdr.collie
```

Note the argument order — the `--plugin` option must follow the action id. This regenerates and enables `collie.service` and launches the bridge on 8787.

Then verify the origin forwarder the same way as after an ordinary deploy — `ss -tln | grep 8788`. See [Restarting Afterwards](#restarting-afterwards) for why the unit states alone do not tell you the bridge is reachable.

Tracked as faviann/dotfiles#84.

### Post-Rebuild Validation

Confirm:

- Every declared path appears in `findmnt` (check one target per invocation; an unmounted bind mount is an empty directory, not an error, and the play recap will not flag it).
- The four hashes from the before-manifest are unchanged.
- Lobu passes its pre-start hash comparison and reconnects as the same registered device after dotfiles convergence (see [Lobu before-manifest](#lobu-before-manifest)).
- The before/after OpenCode and OMP file lists match for `~/.omp` and all three durable OpenCode roots; `~/.pi` remains independently mounted.
- `opencode --version` and `omp --version` succeed from the managed `~/.local/bin` command surface after `workstation-setup` completes.
- herdr restores its session — `herdr-server.log` reports `session restore evaluated … workspaces=N`.
- herdr lists the same registered plugins.
- Collie starts with the same VAPID identity. An unchanged `.env` hash is the proof: had the identity been lost, Collie would have minted a new keypair and rewritten the file.
- The enrolled Android device receives a push without re-enrollment.

Do not diagnose a missing push as lost VAPID material before checking that `8788` is listening. An unreachable device and a lost identity look identical from the phone, and the forwarder being down is much the likelier cause. Without a before-manifest to compare the `.env` hash against, Collie's startup line `[push] enabled (N saved subscription(s))` is the fallback proof: a non-zero N means the subscriptions survived.

Live pane processes do **not** survive an LXC rebuild — the container is replaced, so every running process is gone. That is expected and is not a validation failure. herdr restores session state reconstructively from its snapshot; it does not resume the old processes.

Stale unix sockets (`herdr.sock`, `herdr-client.sock`) persist on `/ephemeral` pointing at the destroyed server. herdr rebinds them cleanly on startup; they need no cleanup.
