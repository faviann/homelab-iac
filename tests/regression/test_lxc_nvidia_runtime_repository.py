"""Regression test for retryable NVIDIA repository publication.

Ansible exits 0 when a ``--tags`` selector matches no tasks, so a return code
alone cannot tell a real run apart from a run that asserted nothing. Each
scenario therefore also requires its own existing final semantic assertion task
to have run and passed, read out of the machine-readable report emitted by a
fixture-local stdout callback.

Matching the human-facing display with a regex was rejected because it renders
whatever the caller's environment asks for, and that changes without any change
here.

So ``run_isolated_playbook`` pins the display instead of tolerating it: the
fixture callback, zero verbosity, no inherited extra callbacks, leaving stdout
as exactly one JSON document. That breaks if another writer still reaches
stdout, so the safer rule is that stdout which does not parse into the report
fails the test rather than passing it.

This guards each scenario's *final* semantic observation only -- that one task
is required to have run and passed. It does not prove that every assertion
inside a fixture ran.
