"""Local Bitwarden CLI release boundary for workstation regression fixtures.

The `config/lxc_workstation_baseline` role resolves release metadata from
`workstation_bw_release_api_url` and fetches the archive from
`workstation_bw_download_url`. The role has no default for either URL, so
regression fixtures that run the whole role must point both at this loopback
boundary. No test reaches the live GitHub release, while the production
metadata shape, checksum selection, extraction, and install path stay
exercised.
