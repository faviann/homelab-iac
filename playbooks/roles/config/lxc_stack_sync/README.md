# lxc_stack_sync

## Deployment report

`lxc_docker_env_deployment_report` is initialized before stack-source discovery,
then published after reconciliation with exactly these fields:

| Field | Diagnostic use |
|-------|----------------|
| `changed` | Indicates whether managed assets, materialization, quarantine, or network/stack startup reported a change; a converged apply reports `false`. |
| `discovered_stacks` | Lists the desired stacks selected for reconciliation, after any `stack_filter`, so an operator can verify the run's scope. |
| `quarantined_stacks` | Identifies stale stacks moved into quarantine for operator investigation or recovery. |
| `skipped_stacks` | Identifies discovered Compose projects whose startup was skipped, including command skips in check mode or projects outside the selected scope. |

The initial shape is `changed: false` with empty lists for the other fields,
including when the per-host source is absent. Failures continue to surface as
Ansible task failures; this report does not catch them or replace their diagnostics.

Directory creation versus modification and network/startup classifications are
not published. Prerequisite directory observations remain necessary to reject
non-directory paths and preserve metadata on existing directories.

## ComposeManifestPlanner Contract

`tasks/planner.yml` turns discovered per-host stack sources into one execution plan published as `lxc_stack_sync_manifest_plan`.

### Inputs

- `lxc_docker_environment_internal.stacks_source`
- `lxc_docker_environment_internal.shared_mount_source`
- `lxc_docker_environment_internal.shared_owner`
- `lxc_docker_environment_internal.shared_group`
- `lxc_docker_environment_internal.docker_uid`
- `lxc_docker_environment_internal.docker_gid`
- `lxc_docker_environment_internal.path_ownership_overrides`
- `lxc_docker_env_stack_vars`
- `_per_host_j2_files.files`
- `_per_host_static_files.files`
- `_per_host_dirs.files`

### Output

`lxc_stack_sync_manifest_plan` contains:

- `templated_outputs`: relative target paths for `.j2` sources with the `.j2` suffix removed
- `source_compose_specs`: compose sources with rendered or raw content plus target path metadata
- `stack_dirs_to_create`: absolute stack directory paths under the shared mount
- `files_to_render`: templated source files with `source_path`, `dest_path`, `relative_path`, `stack_name`, and effective `owner`, `group`, and `mode`
- `files_to_copy`: static source files with `source_path`, `dest_path`, `relative_path`, `stack_name`, and effective `owner`, `group`, and `mode`
- `stack_metadata`: parsed non-secret `stack.yaml` files, keyed by `stack_name`, kept as role-scoped plan data and never injected into Ansible host/global variable scope
- `prereq_dirs`: resolved `x-prereq-dirs` creation candidates with `path`, `owner`, `group`, and `mode`; materialization narrows this to paths observed as missing
- `ownership_overrides`: passthrough ownership override entries from `lxc_docker_environment_internal`
- `managed_files`: resolved `x-managed-files` entries with `path`, `owner`, `group`, and `mode`
- `managed_file_parent_dirs`: parent directories for managed files with `path`, `owner`, `group`, and `mode`

### Guarantees

- `managed_files` are deduplicated by `path`
- relative `x-prereq-dirs` and `x-managed-files` paths are resolved from the compose target directory
- `prereq_dirs` exclude paths that are already covered by `path_ownership_overrides`
- `x-prereq-dirs` paths are created with shared Docker ownership and mode `0755` only when absent; existing directory metadata is preserved
- synced files use matching `x-managed-files` metadata during their single render or copy; undeclared files use shared ownership and mode `0644`
- managed files that are not repository-synced are created empty when absent and keep their declared metadata enforced without truncating existing content
- `planner.yml` and `materialize.yml` consume `stack_vars` as task-scoped render data, not host scope
- `materialize.yml` consumes the plan and does not re-parse compose extensions inline

### Deploy Exclusions

Stack-local documentation and metadata are repo-only control-plane files. The discovery task filters these paths before materialization:

- `<stack>/README.md`
- `<stack>/docs/**`
- `<stack>/stack.yaml`
- `<stack>/stack.yml`
- `<stack>/metadata.yaml`
- `<stack>/metadata.yml`
- `<stack>/metadata.json`

Only `<stack>/stack.yaml` is parsed into `lxc_stack_sync_manifest_plan.stack_metadata`. It is role-scoped data for stack sync/reporting decisions, not Ansible variable scope. Do not add `include_vars`, `vars_files`, or broad `set_fact` loading for stack metadata.

Stack metadata remains non-secret control data and must not contain vars, secrets, or vault references.
